-## 📌 Weekly Task (New!)
-> **Implement mutation logic in `mutate_payload` method.**
-> See [TASKS.md](../../TASKS.md) for details.
+## Overview
+**DeepSQLi-RL** is a hybrid extension of Liu et al.'s DeepSQLi that combines deep learning with reinforcement learning to automate Web Application Firewall (WAF) evasion. Unlike traditional fuzzers (e.g., SQLMap) that rely on static payloads, DeepSQLi-RL uses a **BiLSTM Seq2Seq** model to generate diverse mutation candidates and a **Q-Learning** agent to adaptively select the most effective variant based on WAF responses.
 
-## What Is Implemented
+This tool was developed as the **Offensive AI Module** for the *Intelligent Cyber-Security (ICS)* master's project at Technical University "Gheorghe Asachi" of Iași.
 
-### Core Components
+**Academic Paper:** [DeepSQLi-RL: Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Extension for Automated SQL Injection Attacks](https://github.com/RaduBalaita/ICS/blob/main/Report.pdf)
 
-**attacker.py** - Reinforcement Learning attack agent that:
-- Uses Q-Learning to learn which payload mutations bypass detection
-- Implements 6 mutation operators (URL encoding, SQL comments, case mixing, whitespace, newlines, null bytes)
-- Sends attacks through the firewall pre-filter endpoint
-- Tracks bypass statistics and successful payloads
+---
 
-### Mutation Operators
+## Key Features
+- **Semantic Mutation**: BiLSTM Seq2Seq model understands SQL syntax and automatically applies obfuscation (e.g., `UNION` → `UN/**/ION`)
+- **Adaptive Selection**: Q-Learning agent selects the most effective mutation from multiple candidates
+- **Targeted WAF Evasion**: Trained on 10,000+ adversarial examples designed to break common blacklist filters
+- **Scientific Benchmarking**: Rigorous evaluation suite comparing multiple approaches
+- **High Performance**: 99.5% bypass rate with adaptive learning
 
-| Operator | Example | Purpose |
-|----------|---------|---------|
-| URL Encode | ' -> %27 | Bypass string matching |
-| SQL Comments | SELECT -> SEL/**/ECT | Break keyword detection |
-| Case Mixing | select -> SeLeCt | Evade case-sensitive rules |
-| Whitespace | OR -> OR (extra spaces) | Alter pattern structure |
-| Newlines | UNION SELECT -> UNION\nSELECT | Multi-line evasion |
-| Null Bytes | ' -> '%00 | Bypass string termination |
+---
 
-### Attack Flow
+## Architecture
 
+The system uses a **hybrid approach** combining two AI techniques:
+
+### 1. BiLSTM Generator (Deep Learning)
+Treats WAF evasion as a machine translation problem:
+- **Input:** Standard SQL injection payload (e.g., `admin' --`)
+- **Encoder:** BiLSTM network reads the payload structure
+- **Decoder:** Generates obfuscated variants (e.g., `admin'%0A#`)
+- **Output:** Multiple mutation candidates
+
+### 2. Q-Learning Selector (Reinforcement Learning)
+Learns which mutations work best:
+- **State:** Payload features (length, encoding, keywords)
+- **Actions:** Select from 7 mutation candidates
+- **Reward:** +10 for bypass, -1 for detection
+- **Learning:** Adapts strategy based on WAF responses
+
+### Combined Workflow
 ```
-1. Select base payload from SQLI_PAYLOADS list
-2. Convert payload to state representation (length, special chars, keywords)
-3. Select mutation action based on Q-table (explore vs exploit)
-4. Apply mutation to payload
-5. Send to firewall /filter endpoint
-6. Receive reward: +10 (bypass) or -1 (detected)
-7. Update Q-table with learned value
-8. Repeat for multiple episodes
+Base Payload → BiLSTM (generates 7 candidates) → Q-Learning (selects best) → Target
+                                                        ↓
+                                                   Learns from result
 ```
 
-## How To Run
+![Benchmark Results](benchmark/benchmark_results.png)
+*Figure 1: Performance comparison showing the hybrid approach achieving 99.5% bypass rate, significantly outperforming both standard attacks (58.7%) and BiLSTM alone (82.3%).*
+
+---
+
+## Performance Results
+
+| Approach | Bypass Rate | Time (1000 attacks) | Improvement |
+|----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
+| Standard Payloads | 58.7% | 10.6s | Baseline |
+| BiLSTM Only | 82.3% | 13.5s | +23.6% |
+| **Hybrid RL-BiLSTM** | **99.5%** | 31.3s | **+40.8%** |
+
+The hybrid approach achieves near-perfect bypass rates by combining the generative power of deep learning with the adaptive selection of reinforcement learning.
